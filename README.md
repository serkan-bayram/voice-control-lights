# voice-control-lights
 Control your TAPO L530 light bulb with voice.
 
 If you have any problem about connect_bulb function try to remove device from your app and add it back.
 Or you might consider to factory reset your bulb by following the instructors that app gives.
   
 Thanks to the PyP100 module for making these possible.
